## About me

I am a Junior QA Engineer with a strong passion for learning and continuous improvement. My strengths include critical, analytical thinking and questioning, as well as curiosity and meticulousness. Over the years of my professional career, I have coordinated teams, working on improving the quality of work of my own, my colleagues, and the entire organization. I regularly reported and drew conclusions for further work, providing such feedback at meetings. My passion has become testing various aspects of digital products, such as functionality, performance, usability, and security. I have basic knowledge and practical experience in testing HTML, SQL, API, XML, JSON. I know various testing methods, types of tests, and techniques. I can use tools like TestRail, DBeaver, Postman, DevTools, Jira, Qase, Trello.
Although I still can’t do automated tests, I am motivated to learn and develop in this field. This approach to work is nothing new for me, as I have always focused on continuous improvement. I enjoy working in a team and collaborating with others. I am looking for a company where I could use my skills and become a valuable team member.
I am interested in the latest trends and methodologies in the field of quality assurance, such as Agile, DevOps, and Continuous Testing.
